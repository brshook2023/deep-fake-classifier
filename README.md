# Identifying Deepfakes with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains my final project for Deep Learning (CSC 381) at Davidson College in the fall of 2020. 

The directions for this project were as follows:

  "Your task for the final project is to apply the deep learning tools and skills you have learned
  to a problem of your choosing that will have a positive social impact. Your deliverable for
  this project will be a blog post describing the problem, its impact, and how youâ€™ve solved it."

My group chose to apply deep learning to classify deep fake images as real or fake. The blog post about our work is contained in **writeup.ipynb**.
